    detect_peaks_1d

    Starting from the largest burst event in the time series at hand, we identify a set of
    disjunct sub records, placed symmetrically around the peak of burst events which exceed
    a given amplitude threshold until no more burst events exceeding this threshold are
    left uncovered.

    Used in Kube et al. PPCF 58, 054001 (2016).

    Input:
    ========
    timeseries.....ndarray, float: Timeseries to scan for peaks
    delta_peak.....integer: Separation of peaks in sampling points
    threshold......integer: Threshold a peak has to exceeed
    peak_width.....integer: Number of neighbouring elements a peak has to exceed

    Output:
    ========
    peak_idx_list...ndarray, integer: Indices of peaks in timeseries
